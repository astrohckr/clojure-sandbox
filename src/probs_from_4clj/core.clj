;; problem 1 (Elementary)
(def nothing-but-the-truth-solution true)
  ;; This is a clojure form. Enter a value which will make the form evaluate to true. Don't over think it! If you are confused, see the getting started page. Hint: true is equal to true.


;; problem 2 (Elementary)
(def simple-math-solution 4)
  ;; If you are not familiar with polish notation, simple arithmetic might seem confusing. Note: Enter only enough to fill in the blank (in this case, a single number) - do not retype the whole problem.



;; problem 3 (Elementary)
(def intro-to-strings-solution (.toUpperCase "hello world"))
  ;; Clojure strings are Java strings. This means that you can use any of the Java string methods on Clojure strings.
